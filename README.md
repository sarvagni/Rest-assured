The testing should include the following scenarios

Pets:
Creating, updating, fetching, deleting, and uploading an image of a pet  

Users:
Create, update, fetch user, and deleting a user 

Orders:
Placing, fetching, and deleting an order.

Since this is an open-source endpoint, the functionality of the APIs might not be very correct.So, handle those glitches gracefully and print out meaningful full statements.

Bonus points will be given if you can perform load testing on these APIs by sending 10's of concurrent API requests programmatically to these endpoints.
